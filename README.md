# SQL Project: RPA Fraud Detection

Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the transaction_data table for Reputable Product Agency (RPA) to identify potentially fraudulent credit card transactions. RPA has been receiving complaints from their credit card processor about fraudulent activities, and the goal is to assist the finance department in detecting risky transactions before they are fully processed. Using SQL, this project involves querying the dataset to uncover patterns, anomalies, or specific criteria indicative of fraud. 

This project included writing querires for the prompts below:

1. Start by getting a feel for the transaction_data table. What are the column names?
2. The finance department noted that some of the fraudulent transactions were recorded as coming from Smokey Bear’s zip code (20252). You agree this is suspicious, it’s unlikely that the fire prevention mascot is using Reputable Company’s services.Find the full_names and emails of the transactions listing 20252 as the zip code.
3. Finance has also noticed a number of pseudonyms associated with fraudulent transactions.The fraudsters thought it would be funny to use ‘Art Vandelay’ for their full name or add a ‘der’ for their middle name.Use a query to find the names and emails associated with these transactions.
4. There are some irregularities in the IP addresses where transactions are originating from.For example, any IP address beginning with ‘10.’ is reserved for internal use.We shouldn’t see IP addresses like this accessing Reputable Company’s service.Find the ip_addresses and emails listed with these transactions.
5. Users are making fraudulent transactions using a temporary email address service. These services provide a short-lived email that can be verified and then self-destructs. Find the emails in transaction_data with ‘temp_email.com’ as a domain.
6. The finance department is looking for a specific transaction. They know that the transaction occurred from an ip address starting with ‘120.’ and their full name starts with ‘John’. Can you find the transaction?
